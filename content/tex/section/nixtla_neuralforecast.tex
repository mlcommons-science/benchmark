\begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth} p{0.07\textwidth} p{0.7\textwidth}}
\hline
Rating & Value & Reason \\
\hline
dataset & 3 & NeuralForecast does not include its own datasets but supports standard datasets (e.g., M4, M5, ETT).
FAIR compliance depends on user-supplied data.
 \\
documentation & 5 & Rich documentation with examples, API references, tutorials, notebooks, and CLI support.
PyPI, GitHub, and official blog posts offer clear guidance for usage and extension.
 \\
metrics & 5 & RMSE, MAPE, CRPS, and other domain-relevant metrics are well supported and integrated into the evaluation loop.
 \\
reference\_solution & 4 & Includes runnable model baselines and training scripts for all supported models.
Some models have pretrained weights, but not all are fully benchmarked out-of-the-box.
 \\
software & 5 & Actively maintained open-source library under Apache 2.0. Offers a clean API,
extensive model zoo (>30 models), integration with Ray, Optuna, and supports
scalable training and inference workflows.
 \\
specification & 5 & Forecasting task is well-defined with clear input/output structures. Framework supports
probabilistic and deterministic forecasting, with unified interfaces and support for batch evaluation.
