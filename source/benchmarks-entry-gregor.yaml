  description: |
    This benchmark evaluates ML models for real-time classification of
    particle jets using high-level features derived from simulated LHC data. It
    includes both full-precision and quantized models optimized for FPGA deployment.
  task_types:
  - Classification
  ai_capability_measured: #Must be a YAML list
  - Real-time inference 
  - Model compression performance
  metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - AUC
  models:
  - Keras DNN
  - QKeras quantized DNN
  ml_motif: #What type of ML is tested
  - Real-time
  type: Benchmark #i.e. actual benchmark, or just describes the application
  ml_task: Supervised Learning
  solutions: '2' #NOT NEEDED. Number of results as a list
  notes: Includes both float and quantized models using QKeras

    specification:
      rating: 9.0
      reason: |
        Task and format (multiple-choice QA with 5 options) are clearly
        defined; grounded in ConceptNet with consistent structure, though no hardware/system
        constraints are specified.
    dataset:
      rating: 9.0
      reason: |
        Public, versioned, and FAIR-compliant; includes metadata, splits,
        and licensing; well-integrated with HuggingFace and other ML libraries.
    metrics:
      rating: 9.0
      reason: | 
        Accuracy is a simple, reproducible metric aligned
        with task goals; no ambiguity in evaluation.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 8.0
      reason: |
        Several baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) are reported
        with scores; implementations exist in public repos, but not bundled as an official
        starter kit.
    documentation:
      rating: 7.0
      reason: |
        Clear paper, GitHub repo, and integration with HuggingFace
        Datasets; full reproducibility requires manually connecting models to dataset.
