      abstract = {High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2--4\texttimes{} with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.},

      reason: |
        Actively maintained and production-deployed (e.g., xAI, NVIDIA); source code available under
        Apache 2.0. Includes efficient backends (RadixAttention, quantization, batching) and full
        serving infrastructure.
    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        The framework clearly defines performance targets, serving logic, and model integration.
        Input/output expectations are consistent, but not all benchmarks are standardized.
    dataset:
      rating: 2
      reason: |
        Does not introduce new datasets; instead, it evaluates performance using existing model benchmarks.
        Only configuration files are included.
    metrics:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        Serving-related metrics such as tokens/sec, time-to-first-token, and throughput gain vs. baselines
        are well-defined and consistently applied.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Provides benchmark configs and example integrations (e.g., with LLaVA, DeepSeek), but not all
        models or scripts are runnable out-of-the-box.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        Strong GitHub documentation, install guides, and benchmarks. Some advanced topics (e.g.,
        scaling, hardware tuning) could use deeper walkthroughs.

      abstract =         {The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the problem of maintaining an accurate leaderboard that faithfully represents the quality of the best submission of each competing team. What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of leaderboard accuracy tailored to the format of a competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called the Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and achieves high utility on real submission files from a Kaggle competition. Notably, we are able to sidestep a powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with no tuning required whatsoever.}

      reason: |
        BSD-licensed software and unified API are available via GitHub and PyPI.
        Supports loading and manipulating large HDF5 datasets across 16 domains.
    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        The benchmark includes clearly defined surrogate modeling tasks, data structure, and metadata.
        However, constraints and formal task specs vary slightly across domains.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        15 TB of ML-ready HDF5 datasets across 16 physics domains. Public, well-structured,
        richly annotated, and designed with FAIR principles in mind.
    metrics:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Domain breadth and dataset size are emphasized. Standardized quantitative metrics for
        model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) are not uniformly applied across all domains.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Includes FNO and U-Net baselines, but does not yet provide fully trained, reproducible
        models or scripts across all datasets.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        The GitHub repo and NeurIPS paper provide detailed guidance on dataset use,
        structure, and training setup. Tutorials and walkthroughs could be expanded further.
