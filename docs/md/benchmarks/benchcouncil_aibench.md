**Ratings:**


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 8.0


  - **Reason:** Task  plasma diagnostic classification  and real-time deployment described; system specs  FPS targets  implied but not fully quantified. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 6.0


  - **Reason:** Dataset is sensor stream-based but not shared or FAIR-documented. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 8.0


  - **Reason:** FPS and classification accuracy reported and relevant. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 7.0


  - **Reason:** CNN model described and evaluated, but public implementation and benchmarks are not available yet. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 6.0


  - **Reason:** Paper and Gemini doc exist, but full setup instructions and tools are still in progress.
