  ratings:
    software:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        BSD-licensed software and unified API are available via GitHub and PyPI.
        Supports loading and manipulating large HDF5 datasets across 16 domains.
    specification:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        The benchmark includes clearly defined surrogate modeling tasks, data structure, and metadata.
        However, constraints and formal task specs vary slightly across domains.
    dataset:
      rating: 5
      reason: |
        15 TB of ML-ready HDF5 datasets across 16 physics domains. Public, well-structured,
        richly annotated, and designed with FAIR principles in mind.
    metrics:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Domain breadth and dataset size are emphasized. Standardized quantitative metrics for
        model evaluation (e.g., RMSE, accuracy) are not uniformly applied across all domains.
    reference_solution:
      rating: 3
      reason: |
        Includes FNO and U-Net baselines, but does not yet provide fully trained, reproducible
        models or scripts across all datasets.
    documentation:
      rating: 4
      reason: |
        The GitHub repo and NeurIPS paper provide detailed guidance on dataset use,
        structure, and training setup. Tutorials and walkthroughs could be expanded further.
