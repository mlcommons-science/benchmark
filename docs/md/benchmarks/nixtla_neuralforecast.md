**Ratings:**


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Targets high-throughput LLM inference via PagedAttention and memory-optimized serving; benchmarks cover many configs.


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 7.0


  - **Reason:** Focuses on model configs and streaming input/output pipelines rather than classical datasets.


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Strong token/sec, memory usage, and TTFT metrics; comparative plots and logs included.


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Benchmarks reproducible via script with support for multiple models and hardware types.


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Excellent GitHub docs, CLI/API usage, and deployment walkthroughs.
