# Benchmark YAML Format

This guide describes how benchmark definitions are stored in YAML and which rules contributors must follow when proposing changes. All authoritative benchmark data lives under `source/`.

- `source/benchmarks.yaml` and `source/benchmarks-addon.yaml` currently hold the published catalogue.
- `source/benchmarks-format.yaml` is the schema. It lists every field and the expected data type.
- `source/benchmarks-sample.yaml` provides an example entry that mirrors the schema with realistic values.

New YAML files can be added to the catalogue when neededâ€”ensure they follow the same schema conventions.

For validation commands and Makefile shortcuts, see `docs/tooling.md`.

## Formatting Rules

- **Indentation**: Use exactly two spaces. Tabs are not allowed.
- **Required fields**: Every field described in `benchmarks-format.yaml` must be present. Do not remove keys.
- **Unknown values**: Use the literal string `"unknown"` if information is missing. Never leave values empty or set them to `null`.
- **Strings**: Wrap string values in double quotes (especially URLs or entries containing punctuation).
- **Lists**: Preserve the list format shown in the schema. Every list element should be indented two spaces relative to the key.
- **Booleans**: Use lowercase YAML booleans (`true` / `false`) unless the schema explicitly requires quoted strings.
- **Multiline text**: Use the pipe (`|`) block style for prose. Do not wrap multiline fields in quotes.
- **URLs**: Provide official benchmark resources (GitHub repository, website, or paper).
- `url` field cannot be `"unknown"`.

## Multiline Examples

Multiline strings should follow this pattern:

```yaml
summary: |
  This is a multiline description of the benchmark.
  It renders as a single paragraph in the generated reports.
```

Lists are indented relative to their keys:

```yaml
keywords:
  - "multitask"
  - "multiple-choice"
```

The rating `reason` fields are often multiline blocks:

```yaml
ratings:
  software:
    rating: 5
    reason: |
      Installation scripts are provided and container images are available.
  documentation:
    rating: 4
    reason: |
      Background and motivation are clear, but deployment details are missing.
```

## Suggested Workflow

1. Copy the skeleton entry from `source/benchmarks-sample.yaml` and paste it into the appropriate YAML file.
2. Fill in each field with benchmark-specific details. Quote strings and follow the indentation conventions.
3. Run the validation commands described in `docs/tooling.md` to ensure the entry matches the schema and that referenced URLs are reachable.
4. Review the diff to ensure only the intended YAML changes are present before opening a pull request.

Following these rules keeps the benchmark catalogue consistent and makes PR reviews straightforward.
