  abstract	= {High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs)
		  requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time.
		  However, existing systems struggle because the key-value
		  cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows
		  and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this
		  memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and
		  redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address
		  this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention
		  algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and
		  paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we
		  build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1)
		  near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing
		  of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce
		  memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the
		  throughput of popular LLMs by 2--4\texttimes{} with the
		  same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art
		  systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The
		  improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences,
		  larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's
		  source code is publicly available at
		  https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.},

  abstract	= {The organizer of a machine learning competition faces the
		  problem of maintaining an accurate leaderboard that
		  faithfully represents the quality of the best submission of
		  each competing team. What makes this estimation problem
		  particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive
		  nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate
		  their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to
		  overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard.
		  Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to
		  design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches
		  therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such
		  as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of
		  re-submission. In this work, we introduce a notion of
		  leaderboard accuracy tailored to the format of a
		  competition. We introduce a natural algorithm called the
		  Ladder and demonstrate that it simultaneously supports
		  strong theoretical guarantees in a fully adaptive model of
		  estimation, withstands practical adversarial attacks, and
		  achieves high utility on real submission files from a
		  Kaggle competition. Notably, we are able to sidestep a
		  powerful recent hardness result for adaptive risk
		  estimation that rules out algorithms such as ours under a
		  seemingly very similar notion of accuracy. On a practical
		  note, we provide a completely parameter-free variant of our
		  algorithm that can be deployed in a real competition with
		  no tuning required whatsoever.}
