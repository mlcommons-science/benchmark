        abstract="With machine learning (ML) becoming a transformative tool for science, the scientific community needs a clear catalogue of ML techniques, and their relative benefits on various scientific problems, if they were to make significant advances in science using AI. Although this comes under the purview of benchmarking, conventional benchmarking initiatives are focused on performance, and as such, science, often becomes a secondary criteria.",

**Ratings:**


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 10.0


  - **Reason:** Scientific ML tasks  e.g., CosmoFlow, DeepCAM  are clearly defined with HPC system-level constraints and targets. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Public scientific datasets  e.g., cosmology, weather ; used consistently, though FAIR-compliance of individual datasets varies slightly. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 10.0


  - **Reason:** Training time, GPU utilization, and accuracy are all directly measured and benchmarked across HPC systems. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Reference implementations available and actively maintained; HPC setup may require domain-specific environment. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** GitHub repo and papers provide detailed instructions; reproducibility supported across multiple institutions.
