  summary: |
    Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) is a benchmark of 57 
    multiple-choice tasks covering elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, 
    law, and more, designed to evaluate a model's breadth and depth of knowledge in 
    zero-shot and few-shot settings.
