**Ratings:**


Specification:


  - **Rating:** 10.0


  - **Reason:** Real-time jet origin classification under FPGA constraints is clearly defined, with explicit latency targets  ~100 ns  and I/O formats. 


Dataset:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Data available on Zenodo with DOI, includes constituent-level jets; accessible and well-documented, though not deeply versioned with full FAIR metadata. 


Metrics:


  - **Rating:** 10.0


  - **Reason:** Accuracy, latency, and hardware resource usage  LUTs, DSPs  are rigorously measured and aligned with real-time goals. 


Reference Solution:


  - **Rating:** 9.0


  - **Reason:** Includes models  MLP, Deep Sets, Interaction Networks  with quantization-aware training and synthesis results via hls4ml; reproducible but tightly coupled with specific toolchains. 


Documentation:


  - **Rating:** 8.0


  - **Reason:** Paper and code  via hls4ml  are sufficient, but a centralized, standalone repo for reproducing all models would enhance accessibility.
