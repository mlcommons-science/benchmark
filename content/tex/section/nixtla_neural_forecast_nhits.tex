\subsection{Nixtla Neural Forecast NHITS}
{{\footnotesize
\noindent NHITS (Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series) is a state-of-the-art model that
improved accuracy by \textasciitilde{}25\% and reduced compute by 50x compared to Transformer baselines,
using hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate sampling .

{\bf Ratings:} ~ \\

\begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth} p{0.07\textwidth} p{0.7\textwidth}}
\hline
Rating & Value & Reason \\
\hline
dataset & 3 & Uses standard benchmark datasets like M4, but does not bundle them directly.
FAIR compliance depends on external dataset sources and user setup.
 \\
documentation & 4 & Well-documented on GitHub and in AAAI paper, with code examples, training guidance,
and usage tutorials. More model-specific docs could improve clarity further.
 \\
metrics & 5 & Evaluated using RMSE, MAPE, and other standard forecasting metrics, integrated
into training and evaluation APIs.
 \\
reference\_solution & 4 & Official NHITS implementation is fully reproducible with training/eval configs,
though pretrained weights are not always provided.
 \\
software & 5 & Implemented within the open-source NeuralForecast library under Apache 2.0.
Includes training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning pipelines. Actively maintained.
 \\
specification & 5 & The NHITS forecasting task is clearly defined with structured input/output formats.
Model design targets long-horizon accuracy and compute efficiency.
