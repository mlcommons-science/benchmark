# MLCommons Science Working Group AI Benchmarks Collection

This site curates a collection of AI benchmarks developed and maintained by the **MLCommons Science Working Group**. The repository provides a structured *ontology* of benchmark definitions, tooling for validation and publication, and a generated website for browsing the collection.

The primary artifact of this project is the benchmark report:

- **Report (PDF):** [benchmarks.pdf](benchmarks.pdf)

Users can explore the benchmark collection through the web interfaces described below. Contributions to the ontology and tooling are welcome, and citation guidelines are provided at the end of this document.

## Online Browsing Views

We provide three views for browsing (each entry links to its detailed page):

- **[Cards view](md/benchmarks/cards/)**: richest UI with advanced filtering, tag-based quick filters, and interactive sorting controls.
- **[Table view](md/benchmarks_table/)**: compact table where you can toggle visible columns and download the data as CSV or JSON.
- **[List view](md/benchmarks/)**: straightforward alphabetical list of benchmark names.

> **Note:** The Markdown pages are generated for web browsing and should **not** be cited.

## Contributing

Contributions to the benchmark collection are welcome. For full guidelines, please see the repository documentation. In brief:

- Proposed changes, new benchmarks, or corrections should follow the workflow described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Benchmark definitions should adhere to the YAML schema provided in the repository.
- All generated content (Markdown, LaTeX, MkDocs pages) is automatically produced; please do not edit generated files directly.

For the complete contribution workflow, consult: <https://github.com/mlcommons-science/benchmark>.

## How to Cite

If you use this repository, the benchmark collection, or any derived artifacts, please cite all relevant works associated with this project, including the benchmark collection itself and the companion papers.
